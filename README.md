# PredictiveTableViewFromTextFieldSwift
A table view that will auto predict based on input from text field in Swift

This is a Swift project that was translated from a Ray Wenderlich tutorial from 6 years ago, blended with a StackOverFlow post from a year ago that attempted to convert the objective C version to swift.
This project takes a UITextField and as the user starts typing a list of possible results shows up in a table view as a sort of Auto complete or auto correct or predictive text. The possible results are from a custom array that the user can create.
